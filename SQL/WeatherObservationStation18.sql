-- Consider  and  to be two points on a 2D plane.

--  happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
--  happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
--  happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
--  happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
-- Query the Manhattan Distance between points  and  and round it to a scale of  decimal places.
